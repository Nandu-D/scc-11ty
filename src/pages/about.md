## Who I am.

My name is Alan Hylands and I am a data analyst and writer from Northern Ireland.

## What I've done.

I've worked in tech, data and analytics for the past 20 years - building, reporting, analysing, managing and mentoring.

## I have:

- Helped nurses provide better care for their patients by more accurately recording and reporting their treatments.
- Allowed small local businesses to successfully sell their goods to all four corners of the globe from the comfort of their own homes.
- Kept the savings of hundreds of thousands of ordinary people safe when the dark clouds of the financial crash loomed over us all.
- Built Customer Lifetime Value models to segment customer bases and get to know the best customers better.
- And much, much more (that I'm not allowed to tell about. Good old corporate NDAs.)


## What I'm doing now.

I currently work for tech company [Zapier](https://zapier.com) as a Senior Data Scientist.
